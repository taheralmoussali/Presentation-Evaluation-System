## Introduction

The Presenter Evaluation Project is developed to evaluate presenters during their presentations or public speaking engagements. The project utilizes computer vision and machine learning techniques to analyze various aspects of the presenter's performance and provide feedback.

The system focuses on four key metrics:

1. Eye contact: Evaluates the presenter's ability to establish and maintain eye contact with the audience. It measures the frequency and duration of eye contact with the audience members.

2. Body movement: Assesses the presenter's use of body language and movement to engage the audience. It analyzes the presenter's posture, gestures, and overall body language.

3. Hand movement: Examines the presenter's hand gestures and movements. It identifies the types and frequency of hand movements used during the presentation.

4. Facial expressions: Evaluates the presenter's facial expressions and emotions conveyed during the presentation. It detects and analyzes various facial expressions to assess the presenter's level of engagement and expression.
